# Switzerland Rework

This is a **Hearts of Iron 4 Base Game Rework**! You can download this mod on Steam: [Switzerland Rework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925983866&searchtext=) 

As the name already suggests, this mod tries to make Switzerland more interesting to play.
Didn’t you ever wish to play as Switzerland and take over the world, but the Generic Focus Tree looked too boring? Do you ever wanted to change the tides, against all odds and make history?
Then this mod is just right for you! 

We tried to make this mod not only as balanced as possible, but also as historical as possible. Descriptions for Focuses and National Spirits etc. will be added later. For the reporting of any flaws whether they are about historical mistakes or bugs, please, consider visiting our discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YQFPXM7) or [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925983866&searchtext=). 

### Finished features: 
- A completely new and unique Focus Tree 
- New National Spirits 
- New Events 
- New States (e.g. Switzerland consists now of 3 States instead of 2) and a new Victory Point (the city of Geneva) 
- A hand-drawn, unique Portrait of the Swiss General, Henry Guisan 
- A new theorist (Paul Scherrer, Nuclear Scientist)
- New Flags and Names, when you change Ideology 

### Planned features: 
- Generate an active threat for Switzerland in the German Focus Tree
- Some unique Icons for the Designers, Concerns and National Spirits (there won’t be special icons for tanks, planes etc. because Switzerland mostly used foreign tanks and foreign plane designs, we still recommend you to use the mod “Unique Infantry Equipment”)
- Have I forgotten something? Probably. 

Have fun playing!
Please consider giving this mod a like and a star-favourite-thingy!
Thank you very much, cheers!
